<h3>(In Alphabetical Order by Last Name, Not Necessarily Listed in Order of Infamy)</h3>
<h3>Calliope of the Future</h3>
<p>Calliope of the Future has been playing and touring since the summer of 2005. Founded in Detroit by vaudeville/circus performer Tovio Roberts as a 3 piece with accordion, sousaphone and drummer, the group has changed faces and shape over time, often having the appearance of a traveling collective of musicians. The main threads of the Calliope’s music are woven with narratives overlaying mathematical structures. They are currently a 4-piece with Tovio playing accordion, guitar, metallophone and mandolin, Helios on drums and other percussion, Michael Lukacovic on stand up bass and Sarah Polzin as esteemed tap-dancer. Their lyrical subjects range from personal to comical, including songs about Nikolai Tesla, famed sci-fi author Alistair Reynolds, and the fundamentalist preacher that declared spiritual war on Tovio’s family when he was a child. The Calliope has toured multiple times since its inception, twice in the states and twice in Europe (on bicycle), selling music, art and writing solely via small distros and shows. They are currently booking a springtime US tour, meant to be followed by a pan-continental bicycle circumnavigation.</p>
<h3>Carnival Epsilon</h3>

Simple items, and yet when you see what happens with them, you will understand why Carnival Epsilon&#8217;s motto of &#8220;Doing the extraordinary with the ordinary,&#8221;is not just a motto, but a way of life. Find out what limits they can push their bodies to. As an added treat, Professor Epsilon will have his famous elixirs on hand, as well as his private collection of the strange, the weird and the bizarre from around the world, all house in his legendary Cryptorium.</p>

<h3>Symphonic Anime Orchestra</h3>
<p>The Symphonic Anime Orchestra (SAO) concept was born in 2004 at Colorado’s premier anime convention, Nan Desu Kan. That year, Kathryn Vedder –a long-time Anime fan and NDK attendee &#8212; approached NDK’s programming director about adding to the convention by incorporating more traditional western instruments.

After a few summer rehearsals, the music began to come together and Japanese pop tunes could now be heard as performed by classical musicians.</p>
<h3>Tanglwyst de Holloway</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Tanglwyst.jpg" alt="" align="right" /> Tanglwyst de Holloway, aka Tonya Adolfson, teaches panels on everything from making your own patterns to basic armor creation, from character creation to proper flirting. She&#8217;s been a professional costumer for 22 years and has worked in the costume shops of Southern Utah University and the Utah Shakespearean Festival. Tangl has done wigs, make up, props and movement for the stage, and turned her impressive set of skills to teaching at Society for Creative Anachronism events. She fell in love with Steampunk while doing panels at conventions, and has thrown herself fully into this intriguing genre. Luckily, many of her skills apply very well to the re-imaginative world of Steampunk and she adores the innovation and freedom Steampunk allows.</p>
<p>Tangl’s book, Thine Enemy’s Eyes, is the first novel released by Fantastic Journeys Publishing. As a co-founder, Tangl looks for submissions from other authors, helping them to tune their writing and realize their dreams. “The company is run by authors, for authors, and is small enough to give you individual attention. We welcome submitters and want to learn about your endeavors!”</p>

<h3>Ukulele Loki and the Gadabout Orchestra</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ukuleleloki.com/">Ukulele Loki’s Gadabout Orchestra</a>: a Denver-based, six-piece chamber-pop band that weaves the lyrical cleverness and melodic considerations of the tin pan-alley era; the chamber-pop and harmonic arrangements of Sgt. Pepper era 60s Psychedelia; the brooding melancholia of 80s post-punk; and the DIY ethos of contemporary indie bands into an unclassifiable genre of it’s own invention. Attempts to describe their music have resulted in terms like “indie-pan alley,” “melancholy circus rock,” and “Sepiachord.” They have played with countless contemporaries, including The Dresden Dolls, the group has also collaborated with Elephant Six members: The Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel.</p>
<p>As Jason Heller wrote in The Onion, &#8220;Ukulele Loki’s Gadabout Orchestra reaches backward, forward, and into deep pockets of timeless pop weirdness, leading tuba, clarinet, trombone, glockenspiel, and melodica on a motley march through lush and bright-eyed melancholy. Threads of Tin Pan Alley whimsy and Kurt Weil-esque menace run through the album.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a pioneer of the current ukulele revival, Loki has been Johnny-Appleseeding the instrument across the US and to Japan since 2000. Additionally, his jobs as a sideshow talker, free-form radio DJ, neo-vaudevillian, and burlesque producer have afforded him unusual outlets for his anachronistic take on song writing. Newer material incorporates modern production, electric effects, and synthesizers. If the Steampunk aesthetic had a time-traveling musical counterpart, it would sound like The Gadabout Orchestra.</p>
