		<h2>AnomalyCon 2012 Guests</h2>
<h3>(In Alphabetical Order by Last Name, Not Necessarily Listed in Order of Infamy)</h3>
<h3>Quincy Allen</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/QuincyAllen.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.diascribe.com/quincy-allen/">Quincy Allen</a> started with the intention of becoming an author. Unfortunately, he was waylaid by  bandits early on who were armed with the age-old phrase “So you wanna be a starving artist the rest  of your life?” He ended up a slave to the IT grind for 17 years, maintaining his sanity with  motorcycles. In spite of the slavery, there was always writing and the dream of becoming an author.</p>
<p>Quincy is notoriously at the helm of Penny Dread Tales volume one, and the highly anticipated volume two slated for release around the time of AnomalyCon 2012. He has been permanently drafted as a Guest/relief author for Radio STEAM, a Steampunk podcast. He is also responsible for diascribe.com and a number of novels and short fiction works.</p>
<h3>Kevin J Anderson</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/kjanderson.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.wordfire.com/">Kevin J Anderson</a> is the author of more than one hundred novels, 47 of which have appeared on national or international bestseller lists. He has over 20 million books in print in thirty languages. He has won or been nominated for numerous prestigious awards, including the Nebula Award, Bram Stoker Award, the SFX Reader&#8217;s Choice Award, the American Physics Society&#8217;s Forum Award, and New York Times Notable Book. By any measure, he is one of the most popular writers currently working in the science fiction genre.</p>
<p>Kevin is really excited about his novels Captain Nemo and Mr. Wells and the Martian enjoying Steampunk fame. Fans of Star Wars may also recognize many of his novels. We are pleased to welcome such a well versed and respected author on Saturday of Anomaly Con.</p>
<h3>BB Blackdog</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/BBBlack2.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.myspace.com/bbblackdoguk">BB Blackdog</a> have a unique sound, with just two bass and drums (no guitars).<br />
They are made up of members from successfull bands INCUBATOR, THE HAPPY CITIZENS and SUPERKCRAUT and have sold over 100,000 albums between them.<br />
They are joining us from Britain, for all you anglophiles, and have thousands of fans worldwide. AnomalyCon 2012 will be kicking off their US tour in 2012!</p>
<h3>David Boop</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/DavidBoop.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://davidboop.com/">David Boop</a> is a brilliant pulp fiction author and has provided great insight to several local authors. He is the author of several great novels, including &#8220;She Murdered Me With Science.&#8221; His quirky humor is a welcome addition to any convention.</p>
<h3>Veronique Chevalier</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/VAL.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.weirdval.com/">Veronique Chevalier</a> is the eccentric Françican (Français-American) Chanteuse (Songstress) known as The &#8220;Weird AL&#8221; of Dark Cabaret.<br />
She&#8217;s an unparalleled Parodist; a Steampunk-lish Chanteuse, and Spooky Polkanista, who has been described as a twisted incarnation of Edith Piaf from an alternate reality &#8211; the one in which her parents are Jim Morrison, and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and her godparents are Lucille Ball and Weird Al.<br />
As a self-proclaimed &#8220;Mad Sonictist,&#8221; she takes maniacal pleasure in combining previously unrelated musical forms into new, unholy combinations. She vows to leave no genre unadulterated in her quest to create the ultimate Sonic Frankenstein&#8230;<br />
She originated the genre of &#8220;Gothic Polka.&#8221; Her twisted brand of humour hits at the core of daily reality. Being gonged off the premiere season of America&#8217;s Got Talent (which is FAKE reality) was irrefutable proof her gifts are wasted on the masses.</p>
<h3>Tanglewyst de Holloway</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/Tanglwyst.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="322" /><a href="http://www.tangledwebsonline.com/index.html">Tanglwyst de Holloway</a> considers herself a costume engineer. Her designs combine practicality, intelligent design and we believe a little A.I. and, more important, she&#8217;s very willing to share those designs with you! With 55 panel options, everything from Armor for All Day Wear to Basics of Patterning to Designing and Fitting a Corset, Tangl&#8217;s repertoire will keep you enraptured! Her ability to see the potential in common things, map it out in 3D, dismantle it into the components in 2D, create a 114 piece wardrobe from it and then explain it to nearly anyone makes her an entertaining return guest. Bring your questions and challenges and see what she can do!<br />
Tonya Adolfson is the author of Thine Enemy&#8217;s Eyes and An Unpolished Gem, books 1 and 2 in the Souls of the Saintlands series. Co-founder of Fantastic Journeys Publishing, LLC, Tonya and her partner John Farmer help self-publishing authors get the help, support and networking they need to give their readers their best work. They connect authors with artists, editors, proofreaders, and other authors to get their product looking professional. From signature fonts to audio book auditions, this company&#8217;s focus is to assist those doing it themselves so they don&#8217;t have to do it all themselves. FJP also takes their associate authors and artists on tour, bringing their books and artwork to venues they might not otherwise see, with the marketing to get you back to writing! They offer panels on Giving and Taking Criticism, Breaking Through Writer&#8217;s Block, World Building for All Occasions, and Where Did The Chicken Come From: When Your Characters Do Things Without You. Feel free to talk to them about your ideas!<br />

<h3>London Homer-Wambeam</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/London.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.wix.com/scarletcube/petrifyingproductions">London Homer-Wambeam</a> is the sixteen year old creator of Petrifying Productions. He has written, directed and produced six films and this is his second time as a special guest at AnomalyCon&#8211;he keeps releasing new movies we all want to watch.<br />
London won &#8220;Best Student Documentary,&#8221; at the New York International Independent Film Festival for his short film about Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity during the summer of 2010.<br />
He placed 5th in the nation at National History Day 2009 for his co-performance on the politics of Dr. Seuss.<br />
London&#8211;who has been homeschooled since kindergarten&#8211;wrote, directed, and edited his feature-length Steampunk moving picture, Forewarned, during the spring and summer of 2010 when he was 14 years old. Forewarned features a cast of 20 and is billed as being “the best airship pirate, time-travel, mad scientist, insane asylum movie of the year.” Forewarned premiered at the Wyo movie theatre in Laramie, Wyoming to an audience of 250 people and was featured at AnomalyCon in March, 2011.<br />
London led his FIRST Lego League robotics programming team to win the Wyoming championship, beating out 60 other teams during the fall of 2010. In 2011 he was a finalist at National History Day for his documentary on the Hindenburg disaster, and won the &#8220;Best in State&#8221; award. It was also an official selection at the SoCal Film Festival that year.<br />
Most recently, London is working to finish his feature film, The Astronomer, which he wrote, directed and edited. This production is a remake of George Méliès’ 1902 film Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon). It will be screened at AnomalyCon 2012 and features music from &#8220;Little and Ashley&#8221; and Steampunk artists &#8220;Unwoman&#8221; and &#8220;Ukulele Loki&#8217;s Gadabout Orchestra&#8221;. He has also announced production plans for a local United Way advertisement set for this spring.<br />
Among his other projects, London is the writer of Tales From a Different Engine, an online steampunk comic, and records weekly podcasts titled Airshipwrecked with Captain Proctor, which are also aired on KOCA 93.5 fm.<br />

<h3>Hydrogen Skyline</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/hs_industrial.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/HydrogenSkyline/">Hydrogen Skyline</a> is a 6-piece progessive/alternative metal band local to Colorado Springs, CO. It is formed by Ashleigh Hittle- vocalist, Cary Hittle- keys/synth, Toni Jacquez- lead guitar, Brook Nelson- rhythm guitar, Chris Mills-Bass, and Jon Vanderbilt- Drums.<br />
The sound of Hydrogen Skyline is taking everyone by surprise and hitting the scene hard, as they give the face of classic Steampunk a melodically gear-shifting sound. Samples of their music can be heard throughout the internet, such as www.facebook.com/HydrogenSkyline or www.reverbnation.com/hydrogenskyline.<br />
AnomalyCon will be sharing the Hydrogen Skyline experience with our steam-powered fans for the first time this year. Prepare yourselves for a great show!</p>
<h3> Terry Kroenung:</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/TKnew.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.terrykroenung.com">Terry Kroenung</a> writes Steampunk, dresses in vests and bowlers for dailywear, and walks his dog with a combat-ready cane. He teaches Bartitsu for the Victorian Antagonistics League, because those balky radium guns tend to malfunction. The author of the award-winning 1862 fantasy *Brimstone and Lily* and its sequel, *Jasper&#8217;s Foul Tongue*, he is inordinately proud of his Steampunk story &#8220;Shyclock, Automaton of Venice.&#8221; Terry has also written a *War of the Worlds* prequel and James Bond parody, *Paragon of the Eccentric*, featuring tentacled temptresses and secret agent Oscar Wilde. Visit his blog at www.terrykroenung.com.</p>
<h3>O.M. Grey</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/airshipcadet.jpeg" alt="" /><a href="http://omgrey.wordpress.com/">O. M. Grey</a> dreams of the dark streets of London and the decadent deeds that occur after sunset. She dons a tight corset, a fluffy bustle, and a teeny-tiny top hat for fantasy conventions where she enjoys meeting fans and participating on panels. Olivia prefers to live in the cobwebbed corners of her dark mind writing paranormal romance with a Steampunk twist.<br />
Her premiere Steampunk Paranormal Romance novel, Avalon Revisited, is an Amazon.com Gothic Romance bestseller. She also writes short stories, relationship articles, and angsty poetry.</p>
<h3>Necro Construct (Formerly Mechthulhu)</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/NCSQ.jpg" alt="" />Necro Construct is an attempt to blend the heaviness, musicality, and structure of Metal, along with the rhythm and danceability of Industrial. Historically, attempts to fuse the two genres have alienated fans on one side or the other.<br />
The idea is that Necro Construct will create music that will appeal to fans of both genres equally. They&#8217;re new to the band scene but the individual members have been around Colorado and are ready to bring the louder Steampunks an incredible musical experience.</p>
<h3>Pandora Celtica</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/AutumnBand.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="436" /><a href="http://www.pandoraceltica.com">Pandora Celtica</a> is reprising their appearance at AnomalyCon at overwhelming request. Last year the song we wrote for AnomalyCon was particularly well received!<br />
We are Pandora Celtica, a dark faerie Celtic acappella band from the land of dreams and myth. The Queens and Kings of the Fae have ordered the creation of our band that we may be a beacon of magic and high art in the mundane realms, both for the mortals and for you, our fellow Bright Beings, who make your home here.</p>
<h3>Ekaterina Sedia</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/ES1.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://ekaterinasedia.com">Ekaterina Sedia</a> is the author of two steampunk novels, THE ALCHEMY OF STONE and HEART OF IRON. She is also the author of two urban fantasy novels, THE SECRET HISTORY OF MOSCOW and THE HOUSE OF DISCARDED DREAMS, and many short stories published in a number of venues. She edited several anthologies, including the World Fantasy Award winner Paper Cities, as well as Running with the Pack and Bewere the Night. Her next anthology is Bloody Fabulous.</p>
<h3>Kronda Seibert</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/KS.jpg" alt="" /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/KSAuthor">Kronda Seibert</a> is a local legend in her own mind. She took over the Colorado Steampunks in September of 2009 because no one else wanted the job at the time. That group has grown under her tutelage (and a promise of cake) from 32 members to its current 950+ strong. She specializes in event planning and business.<br />
Kronda is the author of most of the episode scripts for <a href="http://radiosteam.com/">Radio STEAM</a>, as well as the voice talent for Captain Dez Black. She prefers that people do not remind her of how young she sounds on recordings.<br />
Kronda&#8217;s first novel, a dystopian steampunk novel about a young heroine possessing a feared power who must race against time to save her ravaged world from being destroyed again, Beneath the Crust, is scheduled to premier at Anomaly Con 2012.</p>
<h3>Unwoman</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/Unwoman2.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="265" /><a href="https://unwoman.com">Unwoman</a> (aka Erica Mulkey) is a San Francisco-based solo cellist-singer-songwriter.<br />
With timeless songs about love gone wrong and classic covers, Unwoman has been a featured favorite at major steampunk, goth, and sci-fi-related events all over North America.<br />
In addition to solo work, she has performed with Voltaire, Abney Park, Rasputina, and Vernian Process. Unwoman has self-produced five original albums over a 10-year span.<br />
In September 2011 she released Uncovered, a critically acclaimed covers collection including songs by Joy Division, Madonna, Front 242, Michael Jackson, Nine Inch Nails, and Tori Amos.</p>
<h3>Genevieve Valentine</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/GV2.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.circus-tresaulti.com/">Genevieve Valentine</a> is the author of Mechanique: A Tale of the Circus Tresaulti. (You can learn more about it at the Circus Tresualti website.) Her short fiction has appeared or is forthcoming in Clarkesworld, Strange Horizons, Journal of Mythic Arts, Lightspeed, and others, and in the anthologies The Living Dead 2, The Mammoth Book of Steampunk, Running with the Pack, Teeth, and more.<br />
Her nonfiction has appeared in Lightspeed, Tor.com, and Fantasy Magazine, and she is the co-author of Geek Wisdom, a book of pop-culture psychology out now from Quirk.<br />
Her appetite for bad movies is insatiable, a tragedy she tracks on her blog.</p>
<h3>JoSelle Vanderhooft</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/jo.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.joselle-vanderhooft.com/">JoSelle Vanderhooft</a> is the editor of the popular Steam-Powered anthologies, which feature lesbian protagonists from all corners of this world and worlds that could have been, and the editor of Fantastique Gearworks, an imprint of Doctor Fantastique&#8217;s Show of Wonders which publishes LGBTQ steampunk, dieselpunk, clockpunk, and more.

JoSelle is also a poet, novelist and reviewer with several works to her name. She currently resides in South Florida with her partner and one beloved, gloriously orange tabby cat.</p>
<h3>Peter J Wacks</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/Peter.jpg" alt="" />Peter has been publishing short stories since 1993, game storylines since 2002, and novels since 2008. His current steampunk project can be found at www.fairypunkstories.com</p>
