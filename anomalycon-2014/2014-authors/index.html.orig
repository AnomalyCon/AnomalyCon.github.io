<h2>Terry Kroenung</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/TerryKroenung.jpg" alt="" />After having been an Army infantry officer leaping out of perfectly-functioning aircraft, a teacher of Crips &amp; Bloods on a wagon train, and Chuck E. Cheese (really), adding &#8216;author&#8217; to the list is almost anti-climactic.<br />
<i>Brimstone and Lily</i>, <i>Jasper’s Foul Tongue</i>, and <i>Jasper’s Magick Corset</i> are the first 3 books in his Legacy Stone series. They are snarky serio-comic YA takes on traditional quest-lit. They include shape-shifting swords, Civil War battles, magic cannonballs, combat pelicans, Captain Nemo&#8217;s sub, kindly Arab terrorists, swimming trees, cyclopean ogres, zombies, lady ninjas, and poop monsters. <i>Brimstone and Lily</i> won the Bronze Medal in Sci-Fi/Fantasy at the 2010 Independent Publishers Book Awards.<br />
His present addiction is Steampunk, both as author and performer. <i>Paragon of the Eccentric</i>, a prequel to <i>War of the Worlds</i>, won the 2013 Colorado Gold writing contest in September, as well as the 2012 Incite Denver contest. A teacher of Bartitsu, he demonstrates Sherlock Holmes&#8217; martial art, an actual Victorian discipline anywhere they’ll have him.</p>
<h2>Paul Lell</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/LellII.jpeg" alt="" />Born and raised in and around Denver, Colorado, Paul grew up with a family that encouraged imagination and looking at the world with a questioning nature.<br />
As a result, he confounded all of his teachers and was always the last to be picked when lining up for sports in gym class. But that was okay, because it gave him more time to figure out what sorts of animals might live in the methane seas of Titan!<br />
He began writing (very, very badly) when he was in grade school, and continued ot write, on and off throughout his school career and beyond. He has not formally studied writing, or literature (yet), but has always had a keen interest in the worlds that other people created, leading to an obsessive consumption of books ever since his first encounter with a good fantasy novel in junior high school.<br />
In his early teens, or maybe before then, Paul started playing role playing games, and instantly took to world-building and plot-mapping. And he&#8217;s been doing it ever since, using time as a GM to flesh out the world of the Kalijor novels, and visa versa. He still games to this day, and is play-testing the Kalijor RPG and source books with a group of great friends and excellent critics!</p>
<h2>R. Joseph Maas</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/rsz_josephmaas.jpg" alt="" />R. Joseph Maas has been writing since he was 7 years old. After decades of practice, his first published work is premiering at this year&#8217;s convention. As a husband and father, he spends whatever free time is left perfecting his craft and completing chapters of the Tales of the God-Hand graphic novel series and running his own business Watchmaker Entertainment LLC. Please, feel free to follow along with the book&#8217;s development at www.facebook.com/talesofthegodhand.</p>
<h2>Pamela M. Nihiser</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/PamelaNihiser.jpg" alt="" />Pamela M. Nihiser grew up in a military family. Her Aunt Doris introduced her to horror at 11 years old and she was hooked. She has now settled in Colorado springs; writing short stories for different publications in the genres of horror, fantasy, steampunk and scifi.</p>
<h2>Steven Harper Piziks</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/PiziksII.JPG" alt="" />Steven Harper Piziks was born in Saginaw, Michigan, but he moved around a lot and has lived in Wisconsin, Germany, and (briefly) Ukraine. Currently he lives with his three sons in southeastern Michigan.<br />
His novels include In the Company of Mind and Corporate Mentality, both science fiction published by Baen Books. Writing as Steven Harper for Roc Books, he has produced The Silent Empire series. He’s also written books based on Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and The Ghost Whisperer, as well as the movie novelization Identity, which he managed under a deadline of only three weeks. His numerous short stories have appeared, among other places, in all but one of Esther Friesner’s Chicks in Chainmail anthologies and in all of her humorous suburban fantasy anthology. Currently he’s working on The Clockwork Empire steampunk trilogy for Ace Book, and The Doomsday Vault, the first in the series, is due out in November, 2011.<br />
Most recently, he’s branched into the field of romantic suspense with Trash Course, written under the pseudonym Penny Drake, a name he swiped from his mother.<br />
Booklist calls his novels “fast, furious, and absorbing,” and “intelligent enterntainment.” Strange Horizons says his work is filled with “fast-paced adventure filled with intrigue and populated with characters you care about,” and The Romantic Times writes that “Harper . . . creates a compelling universe.”<br />
Mr. Piziks currently teaches high school English in southeast Michigan. His students think he’s hysterical, which isn’t the same as thinking he’s hilarious. When not writing, he plays the folk harp, dabbles in oral storytelling, and spends more time online than is probably good for him.</p>
<h2>Xero Reynolds</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/XeroII.jpg" alt="" />Xero Reynolds has been plying his creative efforts for over a decade. As an artist, he&#8217;s been featured in Playstation Magazine, World of Warcraft.com, Child&#8217;s Play Charity, and has lent his comic skills to his own works (Swordwaltzer, Nine Shot Sonata) as well as publication and guest work for Applegeeks, Dominic Deegan, Ctrl Alt Del, Bunny, and Three Panel Soul. As a voice actor, Xero can be heard on such titles as Gantz, Super Dimensional fortress Macross, Xenosaga, Gatchaman, and more. He currently devotes his time to illustration and writing. His first novel of the Steampunk Fantasy &#8220;Archetype Trilogy&#8221;, The Rhyme of the Golden Aegis, is available online as an e-book, and he plans to release novels set in the Swordwaltzer and Nine Shot Sonata universes soon after the trilogy is completed.</p>
<h2>Aaron Ritchey</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/rsz_aaron_ritchey_author_2013.jpg" alt="" />Aaron Michael Ritchey grew up as a garbage can for stories including way too much Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Stephen King. Early on, he started writing and he’s tried to quit, but he just can’t kick. His debut novel, The Never Prayer, was published by Crescent Moon Press in 2012. More recently, he’s gotten steampunky in The Penny Dread Tales Volume III anthology and cyberpunky in the online ezine Electric Spec. Also, his work will be appearing in the second and third issue of a new magazine, Fictionvale. Aaron’s next novel is a happy, little suicide book for young adults and anyone just this side of hopeless. Look for Long Live the Suicide King from Courtney Literary spring of 2014. Aaron lives in Colorado, born and raised.</p>
<h2>Christopher M. Salas</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/rsz_christopher_m_salas.jpg" alt="" />Born and raised in Pueblo, CO., Christopher M. Salas developed a penchant for science fiction and the paranormal from his grandmother and uncle. As a child spending time with his grandmother, Juanita, included watching Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers. His uncle Augustine would tell tales at the dinner table, recounting scenes from movies he had watched, such as Dawn of the Dead or The Exorcist. This played a key role in Christopher’s predilection for horror and science fiction. Currently residing in Colorado Springs, CO., Christopher dabbles his storytelling in various genres of fiction, such as Science Fiction, Horror, Fantasy and Steampunk. While working on the Abigail: Curses and Demons series, House on Teardrop Lane Trilogy and other literary works, Christopher also is a script writer for Themis Comics.<br />

<h2>A. M. Schilling</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/LozanzicII.jpg" alt="" />A.M. Schilling is a computer geek by day and writes urban fantasy and horror fiction by night–though she won’t stop herself from typing if something else comes out. Born in a town where people were proud to claim their houses were haunted, and told tales of gory battles of the Revolutionary War, she quickly developed an unhealthy affection for gargoyles, poisons, and things that go bump in the night.<br />
The transplanted New Yorker now lives in Colorado with her husband, daughter, and way too many pets. She’s working on a dark fantasy series that brings the monster from Beowulf to life in a near-future world, and is exploring just how many characters she can kill off in each book. She tweets odd words that make her smile under AMSwrites, and can be found blogging about things of no consequence at www.amschilling.com.<br />
She is a member of RMFW, and is currently stalking agents for representation.</p>

<h2>Mark Everett Stone</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/MarkStone.jpg" alt="" />Born in Helsinki, Finland (The Land of the Uncommonly Stubborn), Mark Everett Stone arrived in the U.S. at a young age and promptly dove into the world of the fantastic. Starting at age seven with the Iliad and the Odyssey, he went on to consume every scrap of Norse Mythology he could get his grubby little paws on. At age thirteen he graduated to Tolkien and Heinlein, building up a book collection that soon rivaled the local public library’s. In college Mark majored in Journalism and minored in English. The newspaper business wasn’t for him, so he did what every good writer does: find work in a wide variety of fields that included catering, bartending, and restaurant management. After getting married, he sold Hyundais (before they became popular) and, because he lives in Colorado, Subarus. Eventually he matured enough to be able to sit down and just write and is the author of six books: Things to do in Denver when you&#8217;re Un-dead, What happens in Vegas dies in Vegas, I left my haunt in San Francisco, Chicago the Windigo City, The Judas Line and Living Legend. Currently Mark is working on his newest novel &#8220;Omaha Stakes&#8221; and has two more coming out very soon. Recently, he has been featured in the Arts and Entertainment section of the Denver Post.</p>
