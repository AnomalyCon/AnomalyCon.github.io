		<h2>Lou J Berger</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_lou_author_photo_b&amp;w_option_2-2761_-_copy.png" alt="" />Lou J Berger lives in Denver with three kids, three Sheltie dogs and a kink-tailed cat with nefarious intent. He&#8217;s an active member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, has been professionally published in short form and is writing his first novel, a non-genre YA book set in 1978&#8217;s North Carolina. His website can be found at www.LouJBerger.com.</p>
<h2>Jessica Brawner</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_jessica_brawner.jpg" alt="" />Jessica Brawner sprouted in the wilds of South Texas and plotted ways to spend her life traveling the world. She has been remarkably successful at that endeavor, and is now based in the Front Range region of Colorado. Twelve years ago she discovered the wonders of Science Fiction and Fantasy conventions and has spent the years since working as a booth babe, volunteering for bands and vendors at conventions all over the country. Now she has taken those experiences and written a book: Charisma +1: The Guide to Convention Etiquette for Gamers, Geeks, and the Socially Awkward.<br />
In addition to her convention activities, Ms. Brawner has developed and taught self-defense classes, worked as an event planner, an entertainment agent, a computer teacher, and a personal assistant. Her newest ventures, in addition to her writings, are Story of the Month Club – excellent stories to your inbox (www.storyofthemonthclub.com) and Life Stats (www.lifestats.org).</p>
<h2>Betsy Dornbusch</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_dornbusch.jpg" alt="" />Betsy Dornbusch is the author of several short stories, novellas, and novels. In addition to speaking at numerous conventions and teaching writing classes, she has spent the last decade editing the online magazine Electric Spec and writing on her website Sex Scenes at Starbucks (betsydornbusch.com). She and her family split their time between Boulder and Grand Lake, Colorado.</p>
<h2>Roberto Calas</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_authorpic_armor.jpg" alt="" />Roberto Calas is an author and lover of history. His serial trilogy (The Scourge) is about a 14th century knight fighting his way through a demon-infested England to reunite with the woman he loves. And every bit of it is true except for the made up parts.<br />
In addition to The Scourge series, Roberto has written The Beast of Maug Maurai (fantasy), and Kingdom of Glass (historical fiction in the Foreworld universe). He lives in Sandy Hook, Connecticut with his two children, and visits the United Kingdom on a monthly basis to be with his fiancée, Annabelle. Sometimes he fights demons to reach her.<br />
You can learn more about Roberto on his website: robertocalas.com.<br />
He&#8217;d be most appreciative if you liked his facebook page, too: https://www.facebook.com/RobertoCalasAuthor.<br />

<h2>Sara Campbell</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_3unnamed.jpg" alt="" />Sara Campbell is a Ph.D. student in physics, working in the group of Professor Jun Ye at JILA and the University of Colorado at Boulder. She works on a next-generation atomic clock that has measured time to parts in 1018. The clock is based on the natural frequency of strontium atoms, which are cooled and trapped with laser light. Then an ultrastable laser is referenced to the frequency of the atoms.<br />
Sara did her undergraduate work at MIT, where she also built lasers and other apparatus for cooling and trapping atoms. Now she and her teammates are working on a new experiment that will use the precision of the clock to control thousands of atoms at the quantum level.<br />
When Sara is not playing with lasers, she enjoys climbing and skiing.<br />

<h2>Bill Cherf</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/WJCHERF&#32;MEDIA&#32;IMAGE.jpg" alt="" />W. J. Cherf is a witty, enthusiastic and engaging author, ancient historian and archaeologist, who has been there and dug that.<br />
He created and just completed the award-winning the five book Manuscripts of the Richards’ Trust series to fulfill a life-long desire: “to write books without footnotes,” and to share his love of ancient Egypt. His essential message is: “When it comes to history, there is always more ‘out there’ than meets the eye. You just have to be aware of the evidence and sensitive to the possibilities.”</p>
<h2>Guy Anthony DeMarco</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_demarco_web-5963.jpg" alt="" />Guy Anthony De Marco is a speculative fiction author; a Graphic Novel Bram Stoker Award® finalist; winner of the HWA Silver Hammer Award; a prolific short story and flash fiction crafter; a novelist; an invisible man with superhero powers; a game writer (Sojourner Tales/D&amp;D modules, Interface Zero 2.0 Core); and a coffee addict.

<h2>Tonya DeMarco</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_tonya_l_de_marco_author_pic.jpg" alt="" />Tonya L. De Marco is a Costume Designer, Cosplayer, Model, and Author. She splits her time between the Ozark Mountains of Missouri and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.<br />
She’s been hooked on costumes and costuming since she was a preteen. Growing up reading about the wonderful characters and places created by authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, J.R.R.Tolkein, and Frank Herbert, Tonya turned to costuming as a way to immerse herself more deeply into those fantastic worlds. Her love of the written word also encouraged her to pursue a writing career.<br />
Tonya has over twenty years of sewing experience which includes designing and sewing numerous costumes for school plays and local theater.<br />
Tonya cosplays across multiple genres including anime, sci-fi, steampunk, Disney, comic book, and pin-up. She attends several conventions per year across the country and enjoys meeting and talking with people about cosplay and writing. Tonya has been involved in costume contests/masquerades as both a participant and a judge—at different times, of course!<br />

A former military brat, she loves to travel and meet new people.

For those who like things on the more spicy side of life, she leads a double life as Alexandra Webb. For more info check out www.amylkessler.com and www.alexandrawebb.net</p>
<h2>Bill Keyes</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_billredlantern2anomalycon2014.jpg" alt="" />Bill has been gaming for well over 30 years, starting with the original hardback AD&amp;D books (which he still has, proudly showing them off to anyone foolish enough to ask) in 1980. He discovered the original Champions superhero RPG at the tender age of 11, and has been running various heroic adventures (alternating between D&amp;D and HERO) ever since. People keep coming back to play, so he must be doing something right. A long-time resident of Colorado, he currently lives in Johnstown.<br />
Bill has worked as the layout designer and art director for Hero Games (Lucha Libre Hero, the Hero System Bestiary, Hero System Martial Arts Handbook, Hero System Equipment Guide, and others), and Blackwyrm Publishing (Kazei 5, Terracide, The Fires of Heaven, 3rd World, and others). His first book, The Widening Gyre, is a world of steampunk and sorcery for the Hero System, and a Savage Worlds version of The Widening Gyre was released in 2014. He is also working on a sequel to The Widening Gyre as well as a Retro-Scifi worldbook for Savage Worlds, due in 2015.<br />
Known as &#8220;The Bunny&#8221; by his fellow gamers (for reasons we are unable to explain), he claims to have been elected President in an rigged election, conquered the Midwest, been shot and killed at least once, sworn (and achieved!) vengeance on the gods themselves, crowned himself King of the World, become the arch-enemy of a llama, deposed the Pope, and had torrid love affairs with several well-known movie starlets. It is unlikely that any of these things are actually true, but it&#8217;s best to just humor him when he gets like this.</p>
<h2>Jacqueline Koyanagi</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Jacqueline&#32;Koyanagi_0.jpg" alt="" />Jacqueline Koyanagi was born in Ohio to a Japanese-Southern-American family, eventually moved to Georgia, and earned a degree in anthropology with a minor in religion. Her stories feature queer women of color, folks with disabilities, neuroatypical characters, and diverse relationship styles, because she grew tired of not seeing enough of herself and the people she loves reflected in genre fiction. She now resides in Colorado where she weaves all manner of things, including stories, chainmaille jewelry, and a life with her loved ones and dog.</p>
<h2>Terry Kroenung</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_terry.jpg" alt="" />After having been an Army infantry officer leaping out of perfectly-functioning aircraft, a teacher of Crips &amp; Bloods on a wagon train, and Chuck E. Cheese (really), adding &#8216;author&#8217; to the list is almost anti-climactic.<br />
Brimstone and Lily, Jasper’s Foul Tongue, and Jasper’s Magick Corset are the first 3 books in his Legacy Stone series. They are snarky takes on traditional quest-lit. They include shape-shifting swords, drunken fire sprites riding magic cannonballs, combat pelicans, Captain Nemo&#8217;s sub, swimming trees, Viking zombies, lady ninjas, and poop monsters. Brimstone and Lily won the Bronze Medal in Sci-Fi/Fantasy at the 2010 Independent Publishers Book Awards.<br />
Paragon of the Eccentric, a Steampunk prequel to War of the Worlds, won the 2013 Colorado Gold writing contest in September, as well as the 2012 Incite Denver contest. A teacher of Bartitsu, he demonstrates Sherlock Holmes&#8217; martial art (an actual Victorian discipline) anywhere they’ll have him.</p>
<h2>Paul Lell</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_paullell-author-greyscale.jpg" alt="" />Born and raised in and around Denver, Colorado, Paul has been telling stories (some true, some not so much) for most of his life. This trait led to an early adoption of role playing games and a life-long love of the written word. An abrupt change of career in 2007 gave him the opportunity to publish his first novel, and he’s been at it ever since; trying to outdo himself with each new book.<br />
Currently residing in Westminster, Colorado (he never did make it far from where he began), with his family; a wife, two sons, a giant dog, and two giant cats, he writes daily, reads everything he can, and works on refining his stories, and games at all hours.</p>
<h2>Stant Litore</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_litore.png" alt="" />An emerging voice in weird fiction, Stant Litore has published five volumes of The Zombie Bible, which retell history (and the Bible) as a series of encounters with the restless dead; the first, Death Has Come Up into Our Windows, has been translated into several languages, including Spanish and German. His debut novel was also the #2 horror bestseller on the Amazon Kindle in December 2011. His second novel won second place in the 2012 eFestival of Words Best of the Independent eBook Awards, Horror.<br />
Litore has been a Guest at Denver Comic Con and at several Colorado conventions. He has appeared in interviews for podcasts such as ReelNerds and The Geek Port. He has been featured in “The Year’s Best New Sci-Fi” at NPR (March 2014) and as an Author Success Story on the Amazon.com homepage (November 2013).<br />
He has also been featured in the Examiner, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Huffington Post, SF Signal, and in interviews for Weird Fiction Review and Nomos. Litore was interviewed extensively on the topic of “writing characters your readers won’t forget” for Jeff Vandermeer’s Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction.<br />
