<h2>Sarin Tatroe</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Sarin_0.jpg" alt="" />Sarin is a local artist living in Thornton who has been drawing on and off since she can remember. She is currently trying her hand out as a freelance artist after bidding the corporate world farewell to be a stay at home mom.

Her art is mostly a blend of anime/manga style with a little bit of realism injected into her pieces. Copic markers are her current favorite medium of choice. She has played with water color, watercolor pencils, pencils, and many other artsy mediums and has mixed them all together at times.<br />
She likes to wonder what stories people will come up with when diving into her art since she believes that all art has a story. Sarin is currently working on a few personal projects that seem to never have an end or a definite beginning. Her works may be viewed at http://sariochan.deviantart.com. More recent works are usually able to be viewed at local conventions.</p>
<h2>Stan Yan</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Stan&#32;Yan.png" alt="" />Stan Yan is a Denver-based writer/illustrator, caricature artist and instructor. Growing up in Denver, Yan, a self-taught artist, went to school at the University of Colorado in Boulder where he got his bachelor’s degree in accounting, where Yan’s life took the tragic turn into sales for the securities industry, where he wallowed in ethical poverty on-and-off for thirteen years. Yan takes his frustrations out by penning graphic novels such as <a href="http://stanyan.me/books/the-wang/">The Wang</a>.<br />
In 2005, Yan has gave up on financial security and become a full-time freelance cartoonist, illustrating <a href="http://stanyan.me/books/subculture/">SubCulture</a> for Ape Entertaiment and Action Lab Danger Zone, creating comic strips for the financial and sales industry, drawing zombie caricatures, and picking up odd illustration and teaching jobs when folks are feeling agonizing pity for him. Stan teaches Summer camps, after school programs, workshops, and helped to develop a degree program in graphic storytelling as an adjunct faculty member at the Community College of Aurora. His recent credits include art and colors for Show Devils (Mother Mind Studios), writing and art for Vincent Price Presents (BlueWater Productions / Stormfront Publishing), and art for Alien Abduction (CleverQuickGames). But, he&#8217;s probably best known for doing <a href="http://stanyan.me/caricatures/">zombie and pony caricatures</a>. Upcoming projects include development of a <a href="http://stanyan.me/projects/theres-a-zombie-in-the-basement/">zombie picture book</a> and a <a href="http://stanyan.me/projects/regret-a-cancer-survivors-story/">graphic novel about his best friend&#8217;s battle with cancer</a>.</p>
