		<h2>Shelley Adina</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/shelly.JPG" alt="" />RITA Award® winning author and Christy finalist Shelley Adina wrote her first novel when she was 13. It was rejected by the literary publisher to whom she sent it, but he did say she knew how to tell a story. That was enough to keep her going through the rest of her adolescence, a career, a move to another country, a B.A. in Literature, an M.F.A. in Writing Popular Fiction, and countless manuscript pages. She is the author of more than 30 novels and now teaches in the M.F.A. program as adjunct faculty. Shelley is a world traveler who loves to imagine what might have been. Between books, she loves playing the piano and Celtic harp, making period costumes, and spoiling her flock of rescued chickens.</p>
<h2>Elizabeth Bear</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/bear.jpg" alt="" />Elizabeth Bear was born on the same day as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, but in a different year.When coupled with a childhood tendency to read the dictionary for fun, this led her inevitably to penury, intransigence, and the writing of speculative fiction. She is the Hugo, Sturgeon, Locus, and Campbell Award winning author of 27 novels (The most recent is Karen Memory, a Weird West adventure from Tor) and over a hundred short stories. Her dog lives in Massachusetts; her partner, writer Scott Lynch, lives in Wisconsin. She spends a lot of time on planes.</p>
<h2>Alan Brooks</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Alan&#32;Brooks.png" alt="" />Raised in the murky depths of the mystical city of Atlanta, Alan Brooks has been reading comics since the age of 5. He attended his first con at age 11, and in his teen years, he erroneously thought he&#8217;d outgrown comics, but then he realized, it was just the 90s.<br />
In 2003, he moved to Denver, and became a part of the music and comic creators&#8217; communities. His latest project, a book called Spotless, is a supernatural drama involving the children of fallen angels.</p>
<h2>Vivian Caethe</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Vivian&#32;Caethe.jpg" alt="" />When not fighting crime, Vivian Caethe writes weird fiction, science fiction, fantasy, and everything in between. She has an MFA in Creative Writing from Regis University and is a member of the Editorial Freelancer’s Association. She also drinks copious amounts of tea.

<h2>Roberto Calas</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_authorpic_armor.jpg" alt="" />Roberto Calas is an author and lover of history. His serial trilogy (The Scourge) is about a 14th century knight fighting his way through a demon-infested England to reunite with the woman he loves. And every bit of it is true except for the made up parts.<br />
In addition to The Scourge series, Roberto has written The Beast of Maug Maurai (fantasy), and Kingdom of Glass (historical fiction in the Foreworld universe). He lives in Sandy Hook, Connecticut with his two children, and visits the United Kingdom on a monthly basis to be with his fiancée, Annabelle. Sometimes he fights demons to reach her.<br />

He&#8217;d be most appreciative if you liked his facebook page, too: https://www.facebook.com/RobertoCalasAuthor.<br />
And if you feel you can only take 140 characters worth of him at a time, his twitter handle is, @robertocalas.</p>
<h2>Veronica R. Calisto</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Veronica&#32;Roland.jpg" alt="" />Veronica R. Calisto spends her days massaging data, her weekends massaging people, her evenings teaching people how to massage other people, and the spaces in between elbowing the images and voices in her head into submission. All of this set to music that often spills out in spontaneous song and dance numbers.<br />
If you see a walking musical number shimmying down the street, it&#8217;s probably her. And, if you&#8217;re looking for a nerdy good time, you should probably follow her.</p>

His award-winning series, <em>The Manuscripts of the Richards’ Trust</em>, fulfill a life-long desire: “to write books without footnotes,” and to share his love for ancient Egypt. His message is: “When it comes to history, there is always more ‘out there’ than meets the eye. You just have to be aware of the evidence and sensitive to the possibilities.” He is currently delving into the deep and murky realms of the paranormal, action-adventure, and urban fantasy genres. To find reviews and free chapters to all of his published works, not to mention a handy source for the latest breaking news in Egyptology, go to http://www.wjcherf.com/.</p>

<h2>Evangeline Denmark</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/rsz_denmark-48_with_credits.jpg" alt="" />Evangeline Denmark cannot sing. The tragic discovery of this truth led to bouts of angst-ridden poetry writing in her teens, several ill-advised relationships with literary characters, and the compulsive creation of her own fictional worlds.

Emmy spent three years living full-time in a motorhome as a nomad and is best pigeonholed as an occasionally cross-dressing post-apocalyptic gothic dieselpunk with distinct steampunk and maker tendencies.</p>

<h2>Terry Kroenung</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/Terry&#32;Kroenung.jpg" alt="" />After having been an Army infantry officer leaping out of perfectly-functioning aircraft, a teacher of Crips &amp; Bloods on a wagon train, and Chuck E. Cheese (really), adding &#8216;author&#8217; to the list is almost anti-climactic.<br />
Brimstone and Lily, Jasper’s Foul Tongue, and Jasper’s Magick Corset are the first 3 books in his Legacy Stone series. They are snarky takes on traditional quest-lit. They include shape-shifting swords, drunken fire sprites riding magic cannonballs, combat pelicans, Captain Nemo&#8217;s sub, swimming trees, Viking zombies, lady ninjas, and poop monsters. Brimstone and Lily won the Bronze Medal in Sci-Fi/Fantasy at the 2010 Independent Publishers Book Awards.<br />
