		<h2>Shelley Adina</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/shelly.JPG" alt="" />RITA AwardÂ® winning author and Christy finalist Shelley Adina wrote her first novel when she was 13. It was rejected by the literary publisher to whom she sent it, but he did say she knew how to tell a story. That was enough to keep her going through the rest of her adolescence, a career, a move to another country, a B.A. in Literature, an M.F.A. in Writing Popular Fiction, and countless manuscript pages. She is the author of more than 30 novels and now teaches in the M.F.A. program as adjunct faculty. Shelley is a world traveler who loves to imagine what might have been. Between books, she loves playing the piano and Celtic harp, making period costumes, and spoiling her flock of rescued chickens.</p>
<h2>Elizabeth Bear</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="../../wp-content/uploads/bear.jpg" alt="" />Elizabeth Bear was born on the same day as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, but in a different year.When coupled with a childhood tendency to read the dictionary for fun, this led her inevitably to penury, intransigence, and the writing of speculative fiction. She is the Hugo, Sturgeon, Locus, and Campbell Award winning author of 27 novels (The most recent is Karen Memory, a Weird West adventure from Tor) and over a hundred short stories. Her dog lives in Massachusetts; her partner, writer Scott Lynch, lives in Wisconsin. She spends a lot of time on planes.</p>

They&#8217;ve been seen touring all over the country from Dragon Con in Atlanta to SteamStock in San Francisco, and everywhere in between spreading their music wherever they go. Along the way they&#8217;ve been inspired by the music of all the era&#8217;s they&#8217;ve been to. So get ready for an exciting musical experience with The Cog is Dead!

A rollicking flapper folk punk steampunk cabaret replete with not only guitar and vocal based songs but also Taiko meets Rio de Janeiro pounding drum instrumentals. A French-born singer/percussionist and American guitarist whose start was in the golden days of the hardcore punk scene, collaborated in 2005 to form this melodic, cheeky and energetic duo.<br />
Imagine Siouxsie Sioux and Dee Dee Ramone had a duo that was inspired by Django Reinhardt, Edith Piaf, Toulouse Lautrec and Deepak Chopra, this is what it might sound like. One part Dresden Dolls, Sonny and Cher and one part White Stripes. A pixie spirited flexitarian band of tree hugging, gothic, folky, Steam Punks by way of Paris and New York. Doused in red wine, kale and granola, raised on punk rock and ballet, eclectic and upliftingâ¦fun with a capital F!<br />
This dynamic duo has been a featured performer at Alternative and Steampunk events in the U.S. and overseas including Steampunk Asylum in Lincoln, UK, DragonCon in Atlanta GA, Steampunk World&#8217;s Fair in New Jersey, Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, Wild Wild West Con in Arizona, Clockwork Alchemy in California, SteamTour in Paris, France and many more.
