Her fiction has appeared in award-winning magazines the likes of Strange Horizons and Electric Velocipede and best-selling anthologies Diverse Energies, Federations, In the Shadow of the Towers, and many more.</p>

<p>She’s active in the SFF fandom community and volunteers for a number of non-profit organizations. In the past she’s served as a juror for the James Tiptree Jr. Award, organized fundraising auctions and salons for the Interstitial Arts Foundation, and raised funds for Clarion West, her writing workshop alma mater. Currently she serves on the board of the Carl Brandon Society, an organization dedicated to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the production of and audience for speculative fiction, and is programming co-chair for WisCon 39, a feminist science fiction convention.</p>
<p>Tempest belongs to the New York City-based writer’s group Altered Fluid. You can find her blog and every other bit of relevant information about her at KTempestBradford.com.</p>

<p>Seanan’s first book was released in 2009; she has since released over twenty more (see again, “needs a nap”), both under her own name and under the name “Mira Grant.”  Her work ranges from urban fantasy and biomedical thrillers to poetry and non-fiction, and she can regularly be found complaining about how slowly she writes.  No, seriously.</p>
<p>When not writing, Seanan reads comics, watches too much television, and wanders the world looking for the perfect corn maze.  No one is sure what will happen when she finds it.</p>
