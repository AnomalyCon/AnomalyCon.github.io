Tempest Bradford is a speculative fiction writer by night, a media critic and culture columnist by day, and an activist blogger in the interstices. Her fiction has appeared in award-winning magazines the likes of Strange Horizons and Electric Velocipede and best-selling anthologies Diverse Energies, Federations, In the Shadow of the Towers, and many more.</p>
<p>When not writing science fiction and fantasy or engaging in Interstitial arts she contributes articles, essays, blog posts, and reviews to io9, NPR, and various other media outlets. She enjoys commenting on media as much as consuming it and prides herself on being a “harsher of squee” when it comes to television, movies, books, and other entertainment that doesn’t live up to high standards.</p>
<p>She’s active in the SFF fandom community and volunteers for a number of non-profit organizations. In the past she’s served as a juror for the James Tiptree Jr. Award, organized fundraising auctions and salons for the Interstitial Arts Foundation, and raised funds for Clarion West, her writing workshop alma mater. Currently she serves on the board of the Carl Brandon Society, an organization dedicated to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the production of and audience for speculative fiction, and is programming co-chair for WisCon 39, a feminist science fiction convention.</p>
<p>Tempest belongs to the New York City-based writer’s group Altered Fluid. You can find her blog and every other bit of relevant information about her at KTempestBradford.com.</p>

Calisto spends her days massaging data, her weekends massaging people, her evenings teaching people how to massage other people, and the spaces in between elbowing the images and voices in her head into submission.

<p>Seanan’s first book was released in 2009; she has since released over twenty more (see again, “needs a nap”), both under her own name and under the name “Mira Grant.”  Her work ranges from urban fantasy and biomedical thrillers to poetry and non-fiction, and she can regularly be found complaining about how slowly she writes.  No, seriously.</p>
<p>When not writing, Seanan reads comics, watches too much television, and wanders the world looking for the perfect corn maze.  No one is sure what will happen when she finds it.</p>
